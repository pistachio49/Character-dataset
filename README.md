# Character-dataset
python program to scrape to get the character dataset of different languages 

If python is installed in your system, then pip comes in handy.
So simple steps are:
1) Install virtualenv using

 > pip install virtualenv 
2)Now in which ever directory you are, this line below will create a virtualenv there

 > virtualenv myenv
And here also you can name it anything.

3) Now if you are same directory then type,

 > myenv\Scripts\activate
You can explicitly specify your path too.

Similarly like Linux you can deactivate it like

$ deactivate

To set execution policy
$ Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
